# MLHSample

This repository has been created for submitting code samples to MLH Fellow ship. It contains code of 3 projects and I am providing 3 projects because I think single project, although achieves business need, won't be of substance. The original repositories are also publically available as my github repos and please find below the links to original repositories as well

1. [Resume Scrapper](https://github.com/aamiralidev/ResumeScrapper)
2. [SwanSeaPrintingApp](https://github.com/aamiralidev/SwanSeaPrintingApp)
3. [ComparetiveStatementApp](https://github.com/aamiralidev/ComparetiveStatementApp)

# Project Description & Purpose

### Resume Scrapper 
This project was created to scrap resumes from the online resume builder as those builders also provide sample resumes in different categories. These resumes were scrapped for fine-tuning a large language model on resume generation.

### SwanSeaPrintingApp
This project was created as a freelancing project from a B2B client which receives drop-shipping orders from online stores or sellers. It allows the owner to select a pdf file containing multiple orders, transform it into another pdf file containing pages to print outside the packaging of each order containing information about products inside and the deliver address including some postage labels and customs declaration for international deliveries. 

### ComparetiveStatementApp
This project was also developed as a freelancing project from a client that publishes tenders and receives bids from multiple bidders in the form of excel files. It allows owner to select a list of excel files to aggregate against a particular tender. Then it applies some data preprocessing and transformations using pandas libaray and finally allows the owner to export it as either excel or pdf file. 

# Tech Used
All the apps are developed in Python and the UI for 2 of the apps is developed using Tkinter


## Tip
If you are unable to find any sample input to run, you can go to the original repository from the link, that repository includes sample inputs. I have removed those sample from this repo to reduce the size
