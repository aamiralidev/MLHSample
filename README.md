# MLHSample

This repository has been created for submitting code samples to MLH Fellow ship. It contains code of 3 projects and I am providing 3 projects because I think single project, although achieves business need, won't be of substance. The original repositories are also publically available as my github repos and please find below the links to original repositories as well

1. [Resume Scrapper](https://github.com/aamiralidev/ResumeScrapper)
2. [SwanSeaPrintingApp](https://github.com/aamiralidev/SwanSeaPrintingApp)
3. [ComparetiveStatementApp](https://github.com/aamiralidev/ComparetiveStatementApp)
